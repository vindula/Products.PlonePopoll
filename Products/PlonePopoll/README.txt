About PlonePopoll
#################

This is a Poll tool for Plone.

Requirements
############

* Plone 3.0

Instalation
###########

Add Products.PlonePopoll in your buildout.cfg eggs list.

Use the portal_quickinstaller of your Plone site.

Architecture
############

A poll can be in one and only one of those states:

* enabled
* disabled

Results can be in one and only one of those states:

* visible
* not visible

Poll can have multiple choice activated, determining how many choice a
user can do.


Note
####

Within Plone, it's possible to vote for a poll only if it is enabled
AND published.

Results are displayed only when the *Results Visibility* is set to
visible.


Migration
#########

If you migrate from an oooooold PlonePopoll version (1.x) that's not
Archetypes based, create an external method in your Plone site:

* Id: migrate_popoll
* Title: (whatever)
* Module: PlonePopoll.Migration
* Function: migrateToArchetypes

Then click the "Test" tab of this external method.

CHANGES

Considered future features
##########################

New types of polls may be interesting (Idea from
http://www.apwiz.com/flexivote.htm):

* open poll lets you see results before voting
* in a blind vote you must vote first, but can see all details
* In private poll you see results but not how people voted
* In a secret vote only the owner can see results and voting pattern.

To do
#####

* Test SQL back-end (find volunteers, we don't want to support this in
  the future).

* Cleanup and spread in appropriate external methods what's in
  Extensions/Install.py. We install with GenericSetup from now.

* Provide zconfig features to select and configure the votes back-end
  (see note about SQL back-end above)

* Use a Zope 3 view for the poll to speed up

* Should we keep migrations ? (useless for old AT based Popoll).

* Notify translators about new msgids.

* Why are the entries of the combo in portlet configuration untranslated when the code (browser/popoll.py)
