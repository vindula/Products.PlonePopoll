* After having installed PlonePopoll 2.1, my Plone site raises an exception, what can I do ?
    If you upgrade PlonePopoll from version 2.0x, you have to use the migration script.
    Restart the server.
    Create in your plone site folder (from zmi) an external method
    * Module : PlonePopoll.doMigration
    * Method : doMigration
    * Save and test.
